                <h2> beef</h2>

              Beef, flesh of mature cattle, as distinguished from veal, the flesh of calves. The best beef is obtained from early maturing, special beef breeds. High-quality beef has firm, velvety, fine-grained lean, bright red in colour and well-marbled. The fat is smooth, creamy white, and well distributed. In young beef the bones are soft, porous, and red; the less desirable mature beef has hard white bones. Beef tenderness and flavour are improved by aging; in one common aging method the carcass is hung for about two weeks at approximately 36 °F (2 °C), encouraging physical changes in the muscle tissue that enhance the quality of the meat.Grading standards are somewhat similar in various countries; there is a large international beef trade. In the United States, grades in order of quality are prime, choice, good, commercial, utility, cutter, and canner. Commercial grades are mainly from mature cattle, especially cows. Utility, cutter, and canner grades are used in processed meat products. Beef hide, used for leather manufacture, is a valuable by-product of beef.

                <h2> sushi</h2>
                      Sushi originated in southeast Asia as a way to increase the shelf life of fish by placing it in fermenting rice. A 4th-century Chinese dictionary contains a character that means pickled fish with rice and salt. People discovered that when they placed salted fish into fermenting rice, the fish were preserved by a pickling process. This was the earliest type of sushi. When cooked rice begins its fermentation process, lactic acid bacilli are released. The bacilli interact with the salt to pickle the fish.Sushi is made of small pieces of raw fish that are wrapped in rice and seaweed. The seaweed, called nori, is collected with submerged bamboo nets. While some sushi is mass-produced using robots, the best sushi is made by hand. The sushi rolls are prepared by selecting certain types of fish that meet the highest standards for fat content, color and taste. The sushi chef chops off small bits of the fish and combines them with spices such as ginger root. Wasabi and soy sauce are commonly used to flavor sushi rolls. The chefs use a type of vinegar that is made from fermented rice to flavor the rice that is used to surround the fish and spices. Finally, the roll is wrapped up with some of the nori.
